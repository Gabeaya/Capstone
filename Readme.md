### Capstone Decisions:
* Utilize the MUI within the "firebase" app made with the clever programmer. Try to learn a lot of mui as it does a lot of things you haven't even known existed, let alone know how to do yourself
* Use Google Auth from the firebase-blog app you made with clever programmer.
* The tutorials from firebase blog and dave gray react are compatible
